# klipper_self
self Klipper config file which is not acceptable on the official GitHub page TT. I add some macros to it. 
This page is mainly for backing up, but feel free to use the code and remaking. Ask me befroe disturbution(after 16/1/2023)

## macros
### G29 macros for automatic bed leveling:

You may type "G29 Txx" in the console, where xx is the bed temperature. It is used to reduce the error of thermal expansion and contraction. 
If the perimeter "T" is not provided, it will not preheat the bed and will level under room temperature.

### PREHEAT
Preheat the machine. You can change the temperature in the printer.cfg

*other macros are useless for the human being. It is just for the machine. You may disable them under "Interface setting >> Macros"*
